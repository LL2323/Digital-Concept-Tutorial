# What is HTML?
- HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages.
- It defines the structure of a web page by using elements to specify how content is displayed. In turn, the web browser used these elements to render the contect or web page.

Here is an example of a basic HTML document: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is a basic introduction to HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>


```
And here's what it looks like in the browser:
