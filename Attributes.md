# HTML Attributes
In the previous section, you learned about HTML elements.
- Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element.
- They are defined inside the start tag of an element.
    For example: <p style="color: blue">Hello World</p>
- Attributes typically appear in name-value pairs.
    For example: style="color: blue"
- Not all elements have attributes, and most attributes are specific to their respective elements.
