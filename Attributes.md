What Are HTML Attributes?

Purpose 
- Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. They can define properties, set values, and add functionalities that influence how elements appear and behave on the web page.

Placement
 - Attributes are always included within the start tag of an element. They typically come in name-value pairs, which allows for a wide range of configurations.

Examples of Attributes
Style Attribute:

Example: <p style="color: blue">Hello World</p>

This attribute specifies an inline CSS style, changing the text color to blue.

Class Attribute:

Example: <div class="container">Content</div>

This attribute assigns the element to one or more classes, which can be used for styling with CSS or manipulation with JavaScript.

ID Attribute:

Example: <h1 id="main-title">Welcome</h1>

This attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element, useful for styling and scripting.

Href Attribute:

Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

This attribute provides the URL of a linked resource, used with anchor (<a>) elements to create hyperlinks.

Common Uses of Attributes
Customization: Attributes allow for the customization of elements, making it possible to tailor the appearance and functionality of a web page.

Accessibility: Certain attributes, like alt for images (<img>) or aria-* attributes for accessibility, are crucial for making web content accessible to all users.

Behavior Control: Attributes like disabled for form elements (<input>, <button>) can control user interaction, enhancing the user experience.

Importance of Attributes
